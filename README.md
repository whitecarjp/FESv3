# FESv3
The research aims to develop an Automated Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) based assistive system for people who suffer from paralysis. The immediate remedy for this is rehabilitation that may reduce the chances of muscle atrophy and joint contracture, which is the hardening of the finger joints. The research consists of an electrode matrix system design, an attached flex sensor on the fingers of the subject acting as a feedback system, acquiring the voltage output of finger bending or flexion and control system. Finding stimulation points is with the help of electrodes attached on the arm with the guidance of the big-small matrix system, which will include both big and small electrodes, four 40mmx40mm and twenty 20mmx20mm, in which to be connected to the control unit. Finger flexion is achieved by using electrical signals to stimulate the nerves that control the muscles connected to the fingers. The mounting system is improved by embedding the flex sensor on a non-conductive palmless glove to allow bending of the finger with low physical and mechanical resistance.
